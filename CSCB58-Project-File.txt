Project Details
---------------
Project Title: Tic-Tac-Toe

Project Description: The computer will generate two vertical lines perpendicular
to two horizontal lines on the screen, thereby forming a 3x3 grid. Two players
will take turns putting Xs and Os into a square of their choice in the grid.
The player who gets three Xs or three Os in a row first (horizontal, vertical
or diagonal) wins the game.

Proposal
--------
What do you plan to have completed by the end of the first lab session?:
- We plan to be able to generate the tic tac toe game board (3x3 grid)
on the monitor. Players then have the ability to put Xs or Os on the grid by flipping switches designated
to be controlled for left, right, up, and down shifts followed by enter when their desired choice has been
selected.

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the second lab session?:
- Have a hex display on the DE2 board to keep track of the score for two players.

- Have another hex display to show the count down time for each player when they
are making their choice during each round.

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the third lab session?:
- Have the monitor show which player wins at the end of the game. Allow the
count down time for each player to be shorter depending on the difficulty level
that the player selects.

What is your backup plan if things don't work out as planned?

- If all else fails, our group will pursue the development of a very infuriating game (on the player's end).
You as a player will be provided with a randomly generated lit up segment in one of the
7 HEX displays ranging from HEX1 to the end of the board.
Additionally, you will also be provided with a starting lit up segment in HEX0.
The objective will then be to shift the starting segment's position to match with
the end segments position by the time the game's logic pushes your segment all the
way to the end HEX display. If you succeed in doing this, the next iteration will
move your initial segment to the end segment at a much faster rate thus making
the game more difficult and intense.

What hardware will you need beyond the DE2 board
(be sure to e-mail Brian if it's anything beyond the basics to make sure there's enough to go around)
All we need is an additional monitor with a VGA cable.



Motivations
-----------
How does this project relate to the material covered in CSCB58?:

- In order to display any drawings for the tic tac toe game to a monitor, we need to
apply knowledge about data paths and VGA adapters.
- When a player moves their Xs or Os left/right/up/down on the grid, we need to incorporate finite
state machines and flip flops into our logic.
- We need to use the knowledge we obtained while using 7 segment decoders to demonstrate scores for
each player on the DE2 board.
- We will need to apply the knowledge we learned in building registers and counters to build the
countdown timer for each player selection round in the game.



Why is this project interesting/cool (for CSCB58 students, and for non CSCB58 students?):
- For CSCB58 students, it provides an in depth look into the inner workings of a theoretically
simple game implemented in Verilog, and how useful the knowledge gained from the labs are.
- For non CSCB58 students, this game is an interactive substitute for traditional pen and paper tic tac toe
that may be used to demo or spark interest in hardware programming.



Why did you personally choose this project?:
- We chose this project because we mutually agreed that playing Tic Tac Toe is one of our most
beloved memories from our childhoods, so it would be a nice reminder of it to bring it back during
our university studies.

Our project is inspired by
1) http://www.fpga4student.com/2017/06/tic-tac-toe-game-in-verilog-and-logisim.html
2) https://github.com/JuJuLY/TicTacToe-verilog

There are a few lines of code in the control module that is taken directly from source 2) (see above)
along with the file "grid2.mif", that generates our background. source 1) was solely used
as a guide on how to check for a winning state.



Updates
-------
Week 1: We implemented a feature that enables a user render a pixel with color to specified x
and y coordinates. We had a little bit of trouble with the finite state machine. As a result,
we were unable to repaint the background image after the user pressed the reset button.
It took us longer to debug than we expected, so we were unable to finish the project plan
for this week. However, we will continue to work on the remaining features next week.

Week 2: We created a countdown timer that keeps track of the time that a
player spends on each round of the game. We painted our Tic Tac Toe background
using Microsoft Paint and converted it to .mif file with the corresponding width
and depth that fits the screen resolution and memory. However, we ended up not
being happy with the results so we used someone else's generated file (source 2)).

Week3: We implemented the finite state machine to enable player1 to draw
a red pixel (representing Xs) on their turn and player2 to draw a green pixel (represents Os) as well.
We wrote modules to check the winning status constantly and we output LEDG6
light accordingly. If player1 wins, LEDG7 will light up. Similarly, if player2 wins,
LEDG7 will light up. If there is no winner, i.e. all quadrants are filled but there is
no victor, then both LEDG6 and LEDG7 will remain off.

Week4: we added illegal move checking for each position that player attempts to
place. SW[14] is dedicated to the legal move checking. Before a player can load
and draw their position, they need to check if it is a valid move by setting SW[14] to high.
If the desired quadrant is occupied, the LED light above SW[14] will turn on as a warning.
The player will then have to select a new position to proceed the game.
We modified the finite state machine accordingly in order to make the illegal move
checking works. We also added LED lights to indicate the switches that players
will be using during the game.
